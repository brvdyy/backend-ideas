## Command-Line Utilities
Build simple command-line tools in Rust and Go that perform various tasks, such as file manipulation, text processing, or data conversion. This will help you get comfortable with handling user input, output, and basic file operations.

## File Encryption/Decryption Tool
Create a tool that can encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms. This project will help you understand cryptography principles and working with binary data.

## Basic Text Editor
Develop a simple text editor with features like opening, editing, and saving files. This will give you insights into managing user interfaces, text manipulation, and handling keyboard input.

## Version Control System for Personal Projects
Before attempting to replicate Git, create a simplified version control system for your personal projects. Start with basic features like versioning, branching, and committing changes.

## Web Scraper
Build a web scraper that can extract data from websites and store it in a structured format. This will help you understand HTML parsing, HTTP requests, and data extraction techniques.

## REST API Client
Develop a client that interacts with a RESTful API. This project will give you experience with making HTTP requests, handling responses, and parsing JSON data.

## Data Structures Implementation
Implement various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables in both Rust and Go. This will deepen your understanding of data organization and algorithms.

## Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Implement common sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search) in both Rust and Go. This will reinforce your understanding of algorithmic efficiency.

## Simple Networking Application
Create a simple networking application, such as a chat server or a file transfer tool. This will help you grasp the basics of network programming and communication protocols.

## Basic Interpreter
Develop a basic interpreter for a simple programming language. This will enhance your understanding of parsing, tokenization, and execution of code.

## Mini Compiler
Create a simple compiler that translates a simple language into intermediate code or assembly language. This will give you insights into lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

## Building a Blog or Portfolio Website
Develop a personal website using a web framework in Rust or Go. This project will introduce you to web development concepts, routing, and interacting with databases.

As you work on these projects, you'll not only improve your programming skills but also gain valuable experience in various domains of software development. Remember to approach each project as a learning opportunity, and don't hesitate to seek guidance from online resources, documentation, and developer communities if you encounter challenges along the way. Building a solid foundation will greatly benefit you when you eventually tackle more complex projects.
